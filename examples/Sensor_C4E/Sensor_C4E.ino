   * Temperature parameter
    The sensor is calibrated ex works, meaning that no calibration is required
    before initial startup. During operation the sensor should be calibrated if the
    measured values begin to drift.

    Rinse the sensor in clean water and dry it with a soft cloth or an absorbent
    paper before each calibration.

    For this process it is advisable to use a reference temperature sensor.

    To exit the calibration without considering anything please insert 'Q' to Quit
    and press Enter.
    1. Insert the first calibration standard value you will use (offset) and press Enter.
    0*C is recommended (Sensor fully immersed in an ice/water bath)
    Example: 0.350

    Conductivity parameter
    0. Introduction:

    This is a two-point calibration method. At the end of the process the results
    of the calibration will be stored in the FLASH memory of the sensor for
    future uses.

    The sensor is calibrated ex works, meaning that no calibration is required
    before initial startup. During operation the sensor should be calibrated if the
    measured values begin to drift.

    Rinse the sensor in clean water and dry it with a soft cloth or an absorbent
    paper before each calibration.

    With this process only one range will be calibrated, if desired, carry out
    this process for each range to be calibrated a maximum of 4 times.

    To exit the calibration without considering anything please insert 'Q' to Quit
    and press Enter.
    1. Insert the range to be calibrated from the 4 available ranges and press Enter:
    1 for Range 1 (0 / 200 uS/cm)
    2 for Range 2 (0 / 2000 uS/cm)
    3 for Range 3 (0 / 20 mS/cm)
    4 for Range 4 (0 / 200 mS/cm)
